# Bloch Labs

_Unifying the quantum development stack._

Weâ€™re building two complementary products:

- **Bloch** â€” a modern, openâ€‘source **quantum programming language** with an ideal simulator and CLI.  
- **Bloch Studio** â€” a **web IDE** for building, analysing, and simulating quantum circuits (ideal, noisy, and real QPUs).

## Why now?

Quantum developers juggle fragmented tools, vendor lockâ€‘in, and brittle glue code. Bloch Labs provides a clean, languageâ€‘first workflow and a vendorâ€‘agnostic studio so you can **write, analyse, and run** quantum programs endâ€‘toâ€‘end; on cloud based simulators or on real hardware.

## Our products

### Bloch (Language)
- Outputs OpenQASM directly for portability across quantum backends.
- Clean, readable syntax for intuitive algorithm design.
- Seamless integration of classical and quantum workflows.
- Official [**VS Code extension**](https://github.com/bloch-labs/bloch-vscode)

**Repos**
- `bloch` (compiler, runtime, simulator)
- `bloch-vscode` (VS Code extension)

> Tip: Star the language repo to stay updated.

### Bloch Studio (Web IDE)
- Web based IDE built on the Bloch language.
- Dragâ€‘andâ€‘drop UI based circuit builder.
- Built-in Bloch code editor.
- Run on cloud simulators or real QPU hardware.

> Studio is in active development. Follow along for early access and roadmap updates.

## Roadmap (high level)

- **Language v1.0.0**: stable syntax, OpenQASM codegen, builtâ€‘in ideal simulator
- **Studio MVP**: builder + visualiser, OpenQASM export, ideal backend
- **Noisy + QPU**: licensed noisy simulator, provider integrations via QPU service
- **Education & Docs**: tutorials, course kits, and teaching resources

> Detailed milestones live in repo issues and project boards.

## Contributing

The Bloch programming language is fully open-source. We ðŸ’œ contributors, from issues and docs to core features.

1. Read **CONTRIBUTING.md** in the [bloch](https://github.com/bloch-labs/bloch) repository.
2. Pick up an issue, **good first issue** is a good place to start.  
3. Open a PR, small and focused is best.
